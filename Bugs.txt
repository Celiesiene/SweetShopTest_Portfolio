About Page bugs:

The alert message "20% Off" is visible only on mobile devices (not all of them). The test failed because the message is only visible on certain phones. The notification is not visible on a computer.

Basket Page bugs:

Part of the code related to the payment selection is commented out. As a result, it is not possible to choose Credit Card, Debit Card, or PayPal.
The CVV field has an incorrect input type, allowing negative numbers.
It is not possible to navigate to the About page from the Basket page. The a href attribute contains a typo— instead of '/about', it is written as 'bout'.

Home Page bugs:

.messageContainer h2 'Most Popular' is not visible.

Login Page bugs:

The password field accepts a single character, whether it's a letter, number, or even a space.
The email field validation is too lenient—it only requires any character before and after @ to allow registration.
The Twitter, Facebook, and LinkedIn links have an empty a attribute, meaning they don't lead anywhere.
There is no option to log out.
